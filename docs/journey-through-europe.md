# _The Magnificent_ Journey Through Europe

- Removed the route planning stage from the start of the game
- New non-player character, **Dastardly Dan**

Dan is a freelance immigration officer who deports people travelling without visas.

> "Muhahaha! I am Dastardly Dan, the greatest immigration officer of all time! I won't rest until every last illegal tourist is deported. I've got all sorts of tricks up my sleeve to track them down and send them packing. And if anyone tries to resist, they'll have to deal with my trusty sidekick, Muttley. Together, we'll keep Europe free of unwanted visitors!"

## Setup

Dan starts at a central location on the board. Roll a dice to reveal where:

1. Budapest
2. Zurich
3. Barcelona
4. Paris
5. Berlin
6. Warsaw

Move the black figure to Dan's starting point.

One player will be marked by Dan, as indicated by the black flag. To determine the first marked player, all players roll the dice. The player with the lowest roll gets the marker.

If players are tied with rolls, roll again until one player rolls the least.

### Place cards for players

The place cards are sorted into three colours, shuffled well, and placed face down. Each player now receives one place card; these are dealt as follows: the first player receives a red one, the second green, the next yellow, the next red, and so on.

Each player now receives one place card of each colour, drawn from the top of each place card deck. Players can decide to keep one of these cards and discard the other two. The player must now journey to their chosen card.

## Reaching a city

If they player has visited less than eight cities (not including home), they draw one card from each place deck. The player decides which card to keep as their next destination city.

The player keeps the place card of the city they just reached to keep track of their journey so far.

If this is the player's eighth visited city, they do not draw any more cards and instead must journey towards home starting on their next move. Once a player reaches their home, they win the game.

## Dan's move

At the end of each round of player moves, Dan rolls to dice to  determine his moves. Dan cannot travel by air (he hates planes, at a push he will use a hot air balloon, however this antiquated form of travel is not available to him in today's Europe).
Dan can travel along any water route in one move.

If Dan catches you, you've been kidnapped! Dan has packaged you up and sent you via FedEx to a random city in Europe. Roll the dice to determine the location colour:

- Green: 1 or 2
- Yellow: 3 or 4
- Red: 5 or 6

When the colour is selected, shuffle the place cards of that colour and cut the deck. 
Move the captured player's figure to that place card. Do not carry our any instructions found on the reverse of the place card.

Add the place card to Dan's hand.

After their figure has been moved, the kidnapped player must choose another player to pass the marker to. Dan will now chase this player on his next go.

## Bribing Dan

> Experimental Rule
>
> Before Dan knocks you out, roll a dice. If you get a 6, Dan accepts your bribe and will let you choose your kidnapping destination out of 3 random locations, one from each coloured deck. Shuffle and cut each deck to reveal which locations you can choose from.

Before your turn, you may choose to forfeit moving your figure and instead try to bribe Dan over the phone.

If you choose to bribe Dan, roll a dice. This determines how much cash you have to bribe him with. Dan rolls his dice. This reveals his contract fee.

If you roll the same or less than his contract fee, Dan does not accept your bribe and will continue to chase you.

If you roll greater than his contract fee, Dan accepts the bribe and you can pass the marker to a player of your choice. Dan will start chasing this player on his next turn.

Even if you successfully bribe Dan, you cannot move your piece this turn.

## Winning

If Dan successfully kidnaps players 6 times throughout the game, he wins.

If a player travels to eight cities and returns home, they win the game.
