# _The Magnificent_ Board Games

This is a collection of rule modifications for board games that add a new character, Dastardly Dan.

The idea for this character is based on the board game [The Magnificent Race.](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2256/magnificent-race)

Dastardly Dan must be able to win the game. He should introduce an element of chaos to every game he's added to.
